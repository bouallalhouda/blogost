    <p>This project was given to me by Ismail and it was a perfect opportunity to apply what I’ve learned. Throughout this project, I worked with the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP. I also practiced designing web pages, implementing search functionality, and creating auto-filled forms. Overall, it was a very good experience that helped me strengthen my web development skills and gain practical knowledge.
